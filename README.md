# Reybotics Class
Robotics learning projects for my friend David, structured as a series of lessons on useful topics :)

## Overview

This project is structured as a series of steps which will build our knowledge of basic robotics with the end goal of creating a custom motorized and digitally controlled robot. Self learning will be fundamental to this course and the lab objectives are meant to be the bare minimum of what can be learned. The true value of this course is to help direct our learning and provide bite sized chunks to chew on, and to leave room for further exploration.
